            <h3>It is a city I would like to visit</h3>
            <p>I have been to Hong Kong once at a very young age, but don't remember it, and there are plenty of reasons for why I would want to visit it again. Hong Kong is known for its shopping malls, streets, and markets, skyscrapers, dimsum, parks, hiking trails, and much more. It is even home to a Disneyland Park and Ocean Park. Hong Kong is also multicultural. It is a Chinese region that was invaded by Britain in 1839, and then ceded to the British Empire in 1842. Then it became a special administrative region in China in 1997. So, its culture consists of a mixture of western and Chinese culture. The food and views sound amazing, and apparently there are tons of things to do there.</p>

            <p>Hong Kong Skyline is considered to be the most beautiful skyline in the world. Several notable buildings include: International Commerce Centre, Central Plaza, and Bank of China Tower. There is also a light and sound performance called &quot;A Symphony of Lights&quot; that makes use of several skyscrapers and landmarks on a daily basis if the weather is good. Two good ways to enjoy The Symphony of Lights is to view it from <a href="https://www.chinadiscovery.com/hong-kong/victoria-peak.html" target="_blank">Victoria Peak</a> or the <a href="https://www.afar.com/places/star-ferry-hong-kong-island" target="_blank">Star Ferry</a>.</p>
